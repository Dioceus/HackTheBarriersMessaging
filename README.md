People don’t immigrate for fun. Immigration is a psychologically traumatic experience in which people, especially families, do it because they choose to give themselves and their children better lives. 

In 2013, Faez al Sharaa in south Syria, was walking home when he was held at gunpoint by the military, accused of being a rebel, and about to be shot to death until a stranger lied to the military by telling them that he was her son. 

He fled to America, working the graveyard shift earning minimum wage to support his wife and toddler. 

He is merely one of the 250,000 people who immigrate to Canada each year, and it is obvious that newcomer youth face a variety of issues when arriving to a new country.

Firstly, they face a variety of mental health issues. Those who were displaced forcibly due to political conflict or violence, are often very traumatized. Even if they weren’t forcibly displaced, the very thought of leaving a home you’ve grown up to know, and transitioning into a society that is so foreign to you, is too daunting of a task for youth to go through. For those that have to go through this, they end up suffering consequences to their mental health because of how their life was turned upside down.

Secondly, they face a variety of social issues. Immigrant children have a difficult time learning a new language, adapting to a new culture, and face overwhelmingly higher rates of bullying and suicide. At school, discrimination and racism is very common, making immigrant students feel unwelcome in our society.

Thirdly, they face a variety of economic issues. Because their parents are new to Canada, whom are also forced to learn new languages and new skills for the sake of getting a job to support their family, end up choosing the lowest paying jobs without the proper education required to move on up. These families become victims of piling debt and financial insecurity, and tend to suffer as a result.

However, we have a solution to this problem, that will help soften the impacts of the feeling of uncertainty which come with immigrating to Canada: ITI or Immigration Through Inspiration.

We are a youth-oriented tech company that is creating an app to help newcomer youth adapt.  

The app works by pairing immigrants with mentors. Both immigrants and mentors sign up for the app, by filling out a survey to determine location, language, general interests, etc. Their responses are then recorded in a database created on AWS, where immigrants and mentors are paired by similarity indexes. Immigrants will then be paired with their mentor, where they will be able to share their stories, and mentors will be able to help immigrants adapt and immerse themselves in their new environment.  

Future plans for this app include improve the apps efficiency, adding more languages to the app, and creating a website to increase its outreach and accessibility.
